Things to do to improve the interpreter.

Make a unified memory allocator that all allocations can pull from.
	- Fix memory leaks in ASTNode, Eval, Add Values.
Make a hashtable implementation for environments / symbols.
	- xxhash is a fast, cryptographically insecure way to do so.
	- closed hashing, with <50% occupancy is pretty fast.
Begin implementing a standard library for the APL.
	- Start with material used in J, tryapl.org.
Make a REPL.
	- editline (BSD licensed).
Implement parallelism:
	- (Task?) Throw each operation onto a thread.
	- (Data?) Throw each block (size?) of array elements on a thread.
